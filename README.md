# Python List Manipulation Challenges: Solutions and Explanations
### Overview
This repository contains Python solutions for a series of list manipulation tasks. Each problem demonstrates a specific operation or challenge related to lists, such as counting elements, finding maximum and minimum values, removing duplicates, checking for palindromes, and more.

### Contents
The notebook includes the following problems:

**Count the Number of Elements Without Using len():** Count the total number of elements in a list using a loop.

**Find Maximum and Minimum Values:** Determine the highest and lowest values in a list.

**Remove First Occurrence of a Specified Element:** Remove the first instance of a specified element from a list.

**Calculate the Average of Elements:** Compute the average value of all elements in a list.

**Check If a List Is Empty:** Verify whether a given list is empty.

**Find the Index of a Specified Element:** Locate the index of a specified element within a list.

**Identify Palindromes in a List:** Determine which numbers in a list are palindromes.

**Find Common Elements Between Two Lists:** Identify elements that appear in both of two given lists.

**Remove Duplicates from a List:** Eliminate duplicate elements from a list.

**Sort a List of Strings in ASCII Order:** Sort strings in a list in ascending order based on ASCII values.

### How to Use
Each question is followed by its corresponding Python solution.
The notebook can be run as is, or you can modify the inputs to test different scenarios.
